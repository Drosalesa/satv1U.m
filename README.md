CubeSat heat transfer model
This matlab code is meant to calculate the heat balance in a 1U cubesat subject to low earth orbit conditions; in a heliostationary orbit.
Then it solves the mathematical model to predict the average temperature of the satellite.
Considerations:
1. Heat trasfer by radiation only
2. Heat generated by the iner electronics not considered (commented in the current version of the code)
3. The satelite rotation speed around its "y" axis (pitch) is sincronus (the same face is always facing the earth at any point of its orbit)
4. The satelite rotation speed around its "x" axis (roll) is heliosincronus (the same face is always facing the sun at any point of the year)
5. There is no rotation around its "z" axis (yaw)
